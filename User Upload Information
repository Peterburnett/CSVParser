===============================user_upload.php=================================
  Installation requirements:
  The only requirement for this script is that the installed PHP version to
  operate the script on must be atleast PHP7.0, and have the MySQLi library
  included in the PHP installation.

  The Script is designed for use with MySQL Server 5.6>, higher versions may
  work but this script is tested and validated on this version.

  This script is operatable as a bash function by access using ./user_upload.php
  in the same folder, however this may not work depending on the install
  location of PHP on the system. Changing the first line to match the output of
  'which php' will regain this functionality.

=============================Errors============================================
  The Script continues past any errors it can recover from, however some
  exceptions require the script to stop running. The console will detail any
  errors that are encountered, but incase of a stop, the script will terminate
  with error codes that can be used to identify the issue.

  Exit Code 1: Error with supplied data in options, whether insufficient or
               wrong format

  Exit Code 2: Error with CSV file import, whether wrong location of file,
               or whether script was unable to parse imported file as a CSV

  Exit Code 3: Error with Database connection. This can come from an issue
               connecting to the database with incorrect credentials, or from a
               failed database operation.
============================Options============================================
  --create_table – this will cause the MySQL users table to be built
  (and no further action will be taken)
  --dry_run – this will be used with the --file directive in the instance
  that we want to run the script but not insert into the DB. All other
  functions will be executed, but the database won't be altered.
  --help – this function displays a help message with all of the available parameters
  -u – Required. MySQL username
  -p – MySQL password, defaults to blank if not supplied
  -h – Required. MySQL host
  -d – MySQL Database name to create table in, defaults to 'TestUsers' if not supplied\n";
